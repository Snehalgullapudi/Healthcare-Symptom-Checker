## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### 1. Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Node.js and npm
- Google API Key with Gemini API enabled (from Google AI Studio)

### 2. Backend Setup

```bash
# Navigate to the backend folder
cd path/to/your/project/backend

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install fastapi "uvicorn[standard]" python-dotenv google-generativeai

# Create .env file and add your API key
echo 'GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"' > .env

# Run the FastAPI server
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

The backend API will now be running at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

### 3. Frontend Setup

```bash
# Navigate to the frontend folder
cd path/to/your/project/frontend

# Install npm packages
npm install

# Start the React development server
npm run dev
```

The frontend will typically run at `http://localhost:5173`.
